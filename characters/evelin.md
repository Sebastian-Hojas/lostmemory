I was not supposed to be there this day, and I am not supposed to be here today. It is my life story I would wish not having to tell. On that day, our house was flooded from the storms, and we were being evacuated. My notebook with all my letters, photos and memories fell from the boat, and I tried to catch it. I lost my balance and the stream immediately caught me. Dad told me that Janetta did not hesitate a second and jumped after me. She managed to catch me and drag me closer to the fire men who then managed to pull me out of water. I was already unconscious at that time. They told me that she lost her strength right after having pulled me out of water. They found her unconscious 15 miles downstream.

But on that day in the restaurant, the world was still normal. I am 30 now, so I can barely remember anything from this day, but one thing I know for sure: They asked me to join their game of three friends, but I wanted to make sure I do not make a difference.
