## Tuomas, watchmaker

Who would have thought that we come back together after all this time - and after everything that happened. I remember the day we last met quite vividly. It was just a week before the tragic accident. I would wish to say it brought us closer together, but it had torn us apart.

She is one year younger than Jaakko and me, but she was always the brightest out of us three. From first sight, she did not fit in at all: She was respected around the world, determined and full of ideas. Our lives were subjectively boring compared to hers. On this day she had another of her bright ideas. She asked us to lock a box with a number. Instead of choosing a secret together, we asked a stranger to lock the box with our individual secret numbers and hid it in our garden — to be opened only when we come back together.
I did not have much back then, but I was happy. I picked the sum of all coins I had in my pocket. Boy, if I’d only remember how much it was!

I still cannot process what happened. When I got the news that she woke up from the coma after 17 years, I immediately called Jaakko and Evelin. Nobody would have thought that — after such a long time.
