## Janetta, mathematician

I have trouble concentrating these days. They tell me it is because of the accident. They tell me I saved her life, but I do not remember any of it.
I don’t remember the stories my friends cry and laugh about. I wish I could tell them my side of the story. I wish I would know my story.
Instead, I concentrate on the one thing I have always enjoyed: the tale of numbers. It is way harder these days, but I have always been fascinated more by the simple things anyways. There is, for instance, no number on this planet that divides 55.714.291. Every number in this world can be factored to a set of non-divisible numbers. But there is only 1 and 55714291 that can create fifty-five-million-seven-hundred-fourteen-thousand-two-hundred-ninety-one. In an essence, it is a lonely number. Its existence is its definition. 21.806.341 for instance is the product of 59, 61, 73 and 83. They are all lonely numbers, but together they form something greater.
Our friendship has always been exactly that - three hermits who play to each other’s strengths. It is a cliche that also my age when I first met them, was non-divisible. But then suddenly, I was part of a great product of three individuals. Was that why I suggested the game? I do not remember, but somehow all of this gives me a warm feeling.
