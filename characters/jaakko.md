## Jaakko, traveller

From today’s perspective, I would wish I could not remember this day. It is the last time we have met since then. Until Evelin was born, there wasn’t anyone closer to my heart. I was a really lonely 6-year old boy when I first met them, but they two became my best and only friends.

On that last day, we agreed to go for dinner. I was meant to go alone, but my daughter locked herself into the trunk of the car to join. I was so mad when I found out, but with her mischievous smile, my anger didn’t last long. She was and still is my everything. Tuomas laughed and bought her a piece of cake with the last money he had on his pocket. I still remember him searching for the countless coins in his pocket, and flirting with the waitress to get the cake for a special price, three kroner.

When the time came to choose my secret, I was only looking at Evelin to see how old she already is.
I wouldn’t have thought that things could change so fast. I will be in debt to Janetta for the rest of her life.
