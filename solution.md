# Solution

Jaakko, Janetta and Tuomas are best friends. They met when they were young, and stayed friends for a long time.
One day, they decided to go for dinner together. Evelin, Jaakko’s daughter, managed to join the dinner, much to the annoyance of Jaakko. At the dinner, Janetta suggested to lock a secret in a box. She suggested that everyone should choose a secret number. A stranger will then multiply those numbers and lock the box. She suggested it, to ensure that the box could only be locked when all of them came back together.

- Janetta chose the age, when she first met Jaakko and Tuomas. Clues: Jaakko said he was 6 years, and Tuomas said Janetta was one year younger than them. Thus, she chose 5.
- Jaakko chose the age of his daughter. Clues: Evelin said she is 30, and the accident happened 17 years ago. Thus, she chose 13.
- Tuomas chose the number of the last coins in his pocket, that he used to buy a cake for Evelin. Clues: Tuomas said he got the cake for 3 kroner. Thus, he chose 3.
- Evelin understood the game logic very well, and realised that, despite that she asked to participate, isn’t part of the friends group and chose the only number that wouldn’t make a difference. Clues: Evelin said she doesn’t want to make a difference, and Janetta said that they multiplied numbers. Thus, she chose 1.
- Game: The solution of the game is to multiply all solutions together, `5*3*13*1 = 195`
